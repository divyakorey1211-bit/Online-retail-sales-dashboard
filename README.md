# 📊 Online Retail Sales Dashboard

A modern, insight-driven **Power BI dashboard** analyzing multi-year online retail sales performance. This project transforms a public retail dataset through light data preparation in Python and deeper modeling inside Power BI to reveal trends in revenue, profitability, customer behavior, and regional performance.

Every dataset hides a story — this dashboard aims to uncover *who drives profit, which channels matter, and how regions influence growth*.
